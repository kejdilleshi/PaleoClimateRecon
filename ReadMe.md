# Retrieving climates from the last glacial maximum using an invert glacier model

## Description
This is my thesis project, aimed at inverting paleo glacier footprints to reconstruct paleo climate. The project is divided into two main parts: emulation and inversion.

## Emulation
The emulation phase of the project focuses on simulating the paleo glacier footprints based on available data and historical records. This step involves creating models and algorithms that accurately represent the behavior and characteristics of paleo glaciers.

## Inversion
The inversion phase is dedicated to the reconstruction of paleo climate by analyzing the inverted paleo glacier footprints. This step involves applying advanced techniques to extract meaningful information from the reconstructed footprints and infer past climate conditions.
